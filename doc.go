// Package decor contains a simple-to-user yet powerful template loader
// mainly focussed on the golang built-in templates text/template and
// html/template.
//
// While these packages provide powerful templating facilities with
// great support for rendering textual content, using these packages
// to build a complete layout-based template solution involves a lot
// of boilerplate code. decor tries to fill this gap by providing just
// what's needed to reduce the boilerplate and enable a great developer
// experience.
